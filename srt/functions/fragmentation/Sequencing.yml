summary: |
  Check and correct ordination and orientation of a stream network using a DEM.

description: |
  Mutliscale characterization of fluvial system is based on fluvial linear such 
  as the hydrographic network or the centerline network. To ensure a consistent 
  process, one of the necessary conditions is that networks must be (i) oriented, 
  (ii) connected and (iii) relevant of the in-field configuration. Sequencing tool 
  aiming at ordering and, if it is needed, flipping streams of a network, to ensure :
  
  1. a good flow direction from upstream to downstream.
  2. a good ordination of streams in order to spatially and hierarchically located them within a network.
