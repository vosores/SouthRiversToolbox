displayName: Mean polygon width by DGO
group: othersmetrics
summary: |
  Calculate a poylgon width (ex. active channel width) with the VariableLengthTransects tool
  and resume the result by DGO. 
description: |
  Algorithm:

  - Intersect medial axis and DGOs
  - Measure approximative input polygon width on each DGO
  - Create orthogonal transects from medial axis DGOs, spaced by the sampling interval and with a length of 5*approximative width
  - Cut transects by input polygon and measure length of each one
  - Calculate transects length's mean by DGO

  AGOs are used to accelerate the process on huge datasets. If you don't want to use them, you can
  set an AGO field which contain the same value for all the DGOs. 

  To simply make transects on a medial axis, use directly the VariableLengthTransect tool.
