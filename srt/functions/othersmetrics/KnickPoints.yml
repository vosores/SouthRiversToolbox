summary: |
  Knickpoints detection based on Relative Slope Extension Index (RSE)
description: |
  Knickpoints correspond to anomalies in the elevation profile,
  and are expected to exhibit a sudden change in slope.

  The elevation profile of a stream is normally such that
  the slope is inversely proportional to the distance to the source,
  which can be written :

  $$ H = k . \ln L $$

  where
  \\(H\\) is the height relative to the source,
  \\(L\\) the distance to the source,
  and \\(k\\) is a constant.

  RSE is the ratio between the gradient index \\(G\\) and \\(k\\).
  \\(G\\) is computed for every stream stretch of length \\(\Delta L\\)
  as :

  $$ G = \frac{\Delta H}{\Delta L} L $$

  The higher the value of RSE at some point in the elevation profile,
  the more likely this point is a knickpoint.

    fields:
      - existing fields in <code>INPUT</code>
      - L: upstream channel length (ie. stream distance to source)
      - H: height relative to source = source z - z at knickpoint
      - DL: stretch length
      - DH: stretch height = z at start - z at end
      - HGI: Hack gradient index
      - RSE: Relative Slope Extension index
      - RSET: RSE total = profile height / ln(stream length)
