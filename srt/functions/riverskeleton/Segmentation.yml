summary: |
  Disaggregate fluvial units (polygons or polylines) in DGO of chosen size.

description: |
  Prior to assess metrics to characterize a fluvial system, fluvial units 
  have to be disaggregated. This step enables to discretize a continuum 
  with a constant length in order to provide a higher resolution for 
  characterizing fluvial units. The constant length must be set precisely 
  to ensure spatial trends or relationships between several variables to be 
  correctly detected either at a network scale or at a local scale. Spatial 
  disaggregation can be run both for linear (e.g. hydrographic network, 
  centerline) and polygon feature (valley bottom, active channel).

  Algorithm:
    
      if input type is polyline
        run segmentize algorithm

      elif input type is polygon
        if a centerline is provided
          calculate a AXIS FID field on centerline
          run disaggregate polygon algorithm

      Useful in case of a polygon feature to segment and
      relates to the centerline of this input feature.

      User-defined constant length used to disaggregate
      the input feature (in map unit).
